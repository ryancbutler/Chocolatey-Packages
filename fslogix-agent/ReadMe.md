# FSLogix-Agent
## Description
FSLogix Profiles puts a user’s entire profile into a VHD or VHDX container. This container is typically stored on a file server and attached dynamically as the user logs on. The Windows Search database can also be roamed in the Profile Container. Also, note that roaming the Search Database in a Multi-user environment has specific Windows OS version requirements.  Date / Time stamps are not necessarily updated when VHD writes are complete.
